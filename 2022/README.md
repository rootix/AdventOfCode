# Advent of Code 2022 in TypeScript

Prerequisites:
- some newish node version
- globally installed ts-node (or bun ❤️)

You can run any day by going into the day folder and calling `ts-node puzzle.ts` for the real input or `ts-node puzzle.ts sample` to run against the sample input.

## Note regarding the sample and input data
Due to the rules of Advent of Code, the inputs are not under source control.

You have to get the inputs from the website and add them to the day folders. Name them `input.txt` and `sample.txt`.
