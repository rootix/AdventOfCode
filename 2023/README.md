# Advent of Code 2023 in C#

This year i want to focus solely on the puzzles and have not much spare time to invest into learning a new language.
Rust, someday, i promise.

The project is based on [AoCHelper](https://github.com/eduherminio/AoCHelper) to simplify the execution and having a helpful output.
You can either run the project with:

- `dotnet run` to run only the newest available day
- `dotnet run <day>` to run a specific day
- `dotnet run all` to run all days

The test project allows me to easily run the individual days against the example input.
